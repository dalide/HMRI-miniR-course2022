# HMRI-miniR-course2022

## Organizers
METHODIST ASSOCIATION FOR POSTDOCTORAL AND TRAINEE AFFAIRS (MAPTA)

## Course Plan

Total 4 talks are scheduled so far, and the dates are in January 2022, one hour session for each week. This is the first attempt to organize this kind of lessons for trainees and students of Houston Methodist Research Institute. Hope it goes well and continue to be provided every year afterwards. 

The goal is to help people get more familiar with R programming (potentially beneficial to their research and publications) and not be afraid to dive into it after the lessons. This is meant to be a hands-on experience for the audience, so 30% of the time will be slides presentation and 70% of the time will be live coding with RStudio.

A lot of the contents we will present come from other existing tutorials and workshops. 

## Speakers

- Dr. Licheng Zhang, Bioinformatician, Immuno-Monitoring Core
- Dr. Joseph Butner, Biomedical Engineer/Faculty Fellow, Mathematics in Medicine

## Topics potentially to be covered, one per talk (if we have enough speakers)

- R basics ([slide1](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IUUpHC__LP5f9qm3RjL8L5ArQnfJ1RgvZY9MJWjeUAY/edit?usp=sharing))
- Data wrangling and manipulation ([slide1](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1taRFmJTkt9ME_lwf8ArVJqcqdvQOv_yyrIKsHeCo3k0/edit?usp=sharing), [slide2](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ue6otJr3qTTBxresPthQAEnIfAo0SI1bJ2Ko__aUs94/edit?usp=sharing))
- Data Visualization
- Basic Stats
- R markdown for reports
- RNA-seq analysis (this is more than one hour lesson)

## Preparation: Install R and RStudio

R and RStudio are two separate pieces of software:

- R is a programming language that is especially powerful for data exploration, visualization, and statistical analysis
- RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that makes using R easier. In this course we use RStudio to interact with R.
